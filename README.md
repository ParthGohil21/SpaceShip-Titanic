# SpaceShip-Titanic
Day 1 of my #10DaysOfMl challenge which I started to help beginners through projects. This Repository holds details about Spaceship titanic projects. 

# Overview

Welcome to the year 2912, where your data science skills are needed to solve a cosmic mystery. We've received a transmission from four lightyears away and things aren't looking good.

The Spaceship Titanic was an interstellar passenger liner launched a month ago. With almost 13,000 passengers on board, the vessel set out on its maiden voyage transporting emigrants from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars.

While rounding Alpha Centauri en route to its first destination—the torrid 55 Cancri E—the unwary Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud. Sadly, it met a similar fate as its namesake from 1000 years before. Though the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension!

To help rescue crews and retrieve the lost passengers, you are challenged to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceship’s damaged computer system.

Help save them and change history!

# Tools Overview

The following are the tools that are covered in the notebooks. They are popular tools that machine learning engineers and data scientists need in one way or another and day to day.

Python is a high level programming language that has got a lot of popularity in the data community and with the rapid growth of the libraries and frameworks, this is a right programming language to do ML.

NumPy is a scientific computing tool used for array or matrix operations.

Pandas is a great and simple tool for analyzing and manipulating data from a variety of different sources.

Matplotlib is a comprehensive data visualization tool used to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

Seaborn is another data visualization tool built on top of Matplotlib which is pretty simple to use.

Scikit-Learn: Instead of building machine learning models from scratch, Scikit-Learn makes it easy to use classical models in a few lines of code. This tool is adapted by almost the whole of the ML community and industries, from the startups to the big techs.
